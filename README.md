# Connect Four

Web based clone of the game Connect Four built with React.

- Deployed: https://www.sarahtennis.com/connect-four/
- Rules
  1. Decide who will play first (black always goes first).
  2. On your turn, click above any column to "drop" a chip to the lowest unoccupied position in that column.
  3. Alternate players until one player gets FOUR chips of his or her color in a row. The four in a row can be vertically, horizontally, or diagonally oriented.

## Run locally

From the root directory, change to the `client/` subdirectory.

```sh
cd client/
```

Then run the following script.

```sh
yarn start
```

The project can be viewed in the browser at `https://localhost:3000/`, unless that port is already in use (in which case, check the terminal for the correct port).
